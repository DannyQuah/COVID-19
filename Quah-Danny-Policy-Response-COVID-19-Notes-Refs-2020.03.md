3. Singapore grew 0.7% in 2019. From Feb to Mar 2020, Singapore Government's forecast GDP growth  reduced by 1 percentage point, to the range -0.5 to 1.5%. Might have a full-year recession, the first in Singapore for 20 years. Virus outbreak widely expected to affect all sectors: manufacturing decline -0.3%, wholesale and retail trade by -0.7%, accommodation and food services, -1.6%. Recovery expected only in 2021, growth 2% (1.5%-2.4%).

4. <details><summary>Singapore Government total spending by Ministries is \$83.6bn, with expected deficit \$10.9bn (2.1% of GDP \$508bn); of this \$4bn devoted in 2020 "to help stabilise Singapore's economy and help workers and businesses" over the impending slowdown: 0.8% decline in 2020Q1,  (By comparison, 2009 GFC saw projected deficit of \$8.7bn on a \$20.5bn Resilience Package; that deficit then was 3.2% of GDP). The Net Investment Returns Contribution NIRC contributed \$17bn to government accounts, exceeding corporate and personal income taxes, and GST. NIRC is the single largest source of government revenue.</summary>GDP by adding up quarterly singstat.gov.sg</details>

6. Workers and businesses // Stabilisation and Support package, job and cash-flow support <https://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/budget_2020>

   1. Jobs Support Scheme (New) &mdash; to help retain local workers, Government offsets 8% of the wages of local workers for 3 months; up to \$3600 monthly. Payment to employers by end of July 2020. Singapore has 1.9mn local employees; this will cost Government \$1.3bn.
   2. Wage Credit Scheme (Extant) &mdash; Government co-funds wage rises for Singaporean employees, up to gross monthly wage \$4,000; but now monthly wage ceiling raised from \$4,000 to \$5,000. Co-funding raised by five percentage points to 20% for 2019 and 15% for 2020. This means additional spending of \$1.1bn to 90,000 enterprises, benefiting 700,000 Singaporean employees. 
   3. Care and Support Package &mdash; for help on cost of living in households \$1.6bn. Includes one-off cash payout (\$100-\$300 for each Singaporean, aged 21 or higher)
   4. Corporate income tax rebate &mdash; for 2020, 25% of tax payable, capped at \$15,000 per company. Total cost \$400mn
   5. Faster write-down of plant and machinery investment, renovation and refurbishment, incurred for 2021.
   6. Enterprise Financing Scheme's Working Capital Loan enhanced for one year, doubling loan limit to \$600,000, with Government's share on the loans increased to 80% (from current 50-70%)
   7. Government-managed properties (Housing Board, Singapore Land Authority) &mdash; options for flexible rental payments in the form of installment loans.
   8. Sectors directly affected by coronavirus outbreak: tourism, aviation, retail, food services, and point-to-point transport services will receive additional support (3. below). 
   9. Front-line agencies fighting the outbreak have \$800mn set aside for support; funds going primarily to Ministry of Health.

7. Additional focus on tourism, transport, and other specific sectors:

   1. Redeployment programmes to retain and re-skill workers have funding period extended from three months to a maximum of six. Together with the new Jobs Support Scheme (1. above) this will affect 330,000 local workers.
   2. 30% property tax rebate on specific hotel components and venues; 10% to Integrated Resorts; 15% to cruise and ferry terminals. One-year bridging loan programme with \$1mn loan upper limit, the SNG Government taking on 80% of loan risk, interest rate capped at 5%. 15% property tax rebate to Changi Airport; rental rebates to Changi shops; landing and parking charge rebates to aviation. Commercial
   3. Transport Ministry \$77mn support package for transport services industry, then with government contributions matched by taxi, private-hire car operators: \$20 a day relief for each of 40,000 drivers, for three months.
   4. National Environmental Agency NEA-managed hawker centres and markets: stallholders one month rental waiver; retail and food services sector establishments who commercially rent out properties managed by other government agencies, half-month rental waiver.

8. MOH confirmed cases (analysis):

9. Social distancing, ranging from compulsory quarantine and stay-home notification, backed by full force of law in the form of the Infectious Diseases Act. Contact tracing

10. SHN &mdash; Stay Home Notification

    1. SMS text messages sent you
    2. Give an update on location using mobile phone GPS
    3. Random calls and house visits from health authorities
    4. If you receive a telephone call and are asked to do so, take photos of surroundings to verify whereabouts





Elsewhere or in-principle:

1. Guaranteed paid leave for sick and quarantined 
2. Don't incapacitate the healthcare system. Six-nine months peak will overwhelm most nations' systems.

  - The significance of "Patient 31". Super-spreader
  - 20 Jan 2020, first confirmed case. 35yo Chinese woman flew from Wuhan to Incheon International Airport, Seoul. Isolated. Weeks that followed, only 30 contracted. 
  - "Patient 6" the first to catch the virus locally
  - "Patient 31". Unclear how she became infected - no recent travel overseas or earlier known contact with confirmed cases. But travelled to hotspots in Daegu. On 09 and 16 Feb, attended services at Daegu branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus. On 15 Feb, because she was running high fever, doctors had suggested she be tested for the virus. She denied she'd been so advised. Buffet lunch with friend at hotel. On 17 Feb she got tested; the next day she was confirmed to be "Patient 31". Within days, hundreds connected with Shincheonji Church tested positive.
  - Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) obtained list of 9300 who'd attended the two church services. Of those 1200 showed flu-like symptoms. Hundreds confirmed.
  - Second cluster at nearby hospital in Cheongdo; church members from Daegu attend funeral service at that hospital, 31 Jan - 02 Feb.

Plus DQ notes

What's driving policy response when most COVID-19 infection seems relatively mild:

1. Scale and spread not seen since 1918 influenza pandemic. Current ([Mar 2020, Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00758-2)) estimates of $R_0$ &mdash; the virus's basic reproduction rate, the number of people to which on average one infected person passes on the virus &mdash; 2.0-2.5. COVID-19 spreads more easily than seasonal flu. Today, more than 180,000 COVID-19 infections; took months longer for SARS infections to exceed even 5,000  ([Mar 2020, Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00758-2)).
2. Current ([Mar 2020, Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00758-2)) estimates of COVID-19 fatality rate, lower than SARS, MERS, or Ebola.  However, approximately one in 20 patients requires mechanical ventilatory support, available only in hospital intensive care.
3. Without ICU support, fatality rates will rise above current 0.3-1% estimates. So too will deaths grow from other conditions requiring intensive care.
4. Global circulation and re-circulation; COVID-19 has become an imported commodity. While China, Singapore, and South Korea are seeing falls in domestic transmission, Europe, North America, the Middle East are now in ascendance; and indeed Africa, South America are only just beginning. The big risk now is that those initially most affected but are now already past the thus-far infection peak will see coronavirus importing and thus resurgence of COVID-19 cases.
5. So need to reduce "R" &mdash; the virus reproduction number &mdash; towards zero, or at least as much as possible below 1.
6. China's initial coordinated interventions:
   1. locking down regions with uncontrolled community transmission (Wuhan, large parts of Hubei), preventing coronavirus export;
   2. aggressive detection and contact tracing, prompt isolation and treatment, quarantining of close contacts; 
   3. strict social distancing&mdash;curfews, shutting down public transportation and large events; logistical support to affected population;
   4. Will need to increase travel restrictions, in an aim to reduce coronavirus import.
7. South Korea:
   1. No lock down;
   2. Ramped-up testing &mdash; within 3 weeks, lab networks doing up to 20,000 tests a day, so that earlier diagnosis and isolation;
   3. strict social distancing as well, including school closures.
8. Singapore:
   1. Aggressive contact tracing, quarantining of close contacts of confirmed cases.
   2. Detection: temperature scanning at entrances of many buildings, businesses, restaurants, other public gathering areas.
   3. Testing widely available; nearly 2,000 everyday

In all cases, the tradeoff is between reducing R and socioeconomic costs&mdash;with spillover across inter-dependent countries and territories: state of specific health systems,; restrictions in economic activity through self-isolating intervention

https://www.businessinsider.sg/uk-abandoned-coronavirus-strategy-that-would-cause-250000-deaths-2020-3

Original mitigation strategy: "asking people with coronavirus symptoms to self-isolate for 14 days; elderly people to avoid social contact".

Italy data: Demand for ICUs among those hospitalised higher than initially estimated. Britain had not the capacity to deal with such an outbreak

Switch to suppression strategy: "work at home, limit all nonessential human contact over the coming months"

Danson Cheong. 2020. "[President Halimah gives 'in-principle support' to draw on past reserves for 2nd coronavirus aid package](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/president-halimah-yacob-gives-in-principle-support-to-draw-on-past-reserves-for-second)", Straits Times (26 Mar) https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/president-halimah-yacob-gives-in-principle-support-to-draw-on-past-reserves-for-second

In a message read out in Parliament by Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin, Madam Halimah said she has given her "in-principle support" for the draw - which is before the House for debate.

Such a draw on the national reserves to fund special Budget measures has only happened once before in Singapore's history - during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, when then President S R Nathan approved a draw of $4.9 billion to fund support measures.

This draw will fund a second tranche of support measures, which will be outlined by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat in Parliament on Thursday (March 26), to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.

"["Singapore's reserves are for rainy days, COVID-19 already a 'mighty storm': DPM Heng](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-mighty-storm-singapore-reserves-heng-swee-keat-12578728)", CNA (26 Mar) https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-mighty-storm-singapore-reserves-heng-swee-keat-12578728

SCMP. 2020. [Will Singapore use its reserves to counter the coronavirus?](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/explained/article/3075173/explainer-will-singapore-use-its-reserves-counter-coronavirus), SCMP (15 Mar) https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/explained/article/3075173/explainer-will-singapore-use-its-reserves-counter-coronavirus

"Singapore is considering tapping its past reserves as it puts together a second relief package amid the deadly coronavirus outbreak. If it makes the move, it will be the second time the government has drawn on the reserves, with the first instance occurring in 2009, when it used them to cushion the effects of the global financial crisis."

Julia Yeo. 2020. "[Singapore to draw S$17 billion from past reserves for new economic package, 2nd time in history](https://mothership.sg/2020/03/17-billion-reserves-withdrawal/)", Mothership.sg (26 Mar) https://mothership.sg/2020/03/17-billion-reserves-withdrawal/

It would be the second time in Singapore’s history where the government would draw from the country’s reserves.

The first time was during the 2009 financial crisis, where the government withdrew S$4 billion from past reserves to fund two measures to boost the economy: the Jobs Credit scheme and the Special Risk-Sharing Initiative.

The funds were later returned to the reserves in 2011, after the economy picked up.

Yen Nee Lee. 2020. "[Singapore plans a massive $33.2 billion package to tide its economy through the coronavirus outbreak](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/26/coronavirus-singapore-plans-another-stimulus-package-for-its-economy.html)", CNBC (26 Mar) https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/26/coronavirus-singapore-plans-another-stimulus-package-for-its-economy.html

- To fund the new measures, the government will draw up to 17 billion Singapore dollars (\$11.78 billion) from the country’s reserves.
- The exact amount of Singapore’s reserves is a state secret, but various estimates have placed it at hundreds of billions in U.S. dollars.
- This is only the second time that Singapore has dipped into its reserves. The first time it did so was in 2009, during the global financial crisis, when the government drew 4.9 billion Singapore dollars ($3.40 billion).

Dear Colleagues

I wish to clarify a few things:

- While I say Team A and Team B should avoid meeting each other, **I did not say they cannot meet**. If you impose social distancing measure, it is still possible. Social distancing reduces the risk of infection (significantly), while Team A – Team B mode minimizes the risk of the whole team being infected or quarantined. You may notice the picture of a parliament seating in the ST today. Another example – Teck Hua and I are in different teams, but we still meet our Chairman together – we are just seated at three different corners of the large BOT conference table. My point is that, if for some reason, some member of Team A has to meet with some member of Team B, it can still be done, as long as they are separated by more than 2 metres.
- Our situation is **not** a lock down situation, and so **please do not over react** to the recent MOH’s new advisories. We have reduced  class sizes to 25 from next week, and so no need to make **all** classes to go e-learning. **No need to cancel all physical meetings** – they can go on, but with more precautions taken, e.g., seated 2 metres apart, and having shorter meetings (not necessarily meaning that it must be less than 30 minutes).

 

Thanks

**Subject:** Business Continuity Plan 2020Mar14 - Covid-19 Mitigations

 

Dear Colleagues,

 

Yesterday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) introduced a series of additional precautionary measures to prevent further importation and spread of COVID-19 cases. (See [link](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/additional-precautionary-measures-to-prevent-further-importation-and-spread-of-covid-19-cases).) Apart from stepping up on travel restrictions and border controls, MOH has recommended social distancing measures; there are advisories on large events and gatherings, work places, and public venues.

 

Regarding work places, MOH’s advisory reads: “Employers are advised to put in place measures to reduce close contact where feasible. For example, employers should implement tele-commuting and video-conferencing where possible, as well as stagger work hours, and allow employees to commute at off-peak hours. Seating in meeting rooms and work stations could also be spaced apart.”

 

In Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s recent [message](https://www.pmo.gov.sg/Newsroom/PM-Lee-remarks-COVID-19-Outbreak-12-Mar-2020) , he emphasised that the situation in Singapore remains under control, and that Singapore is NOT going to DORSCON Red. What Singapore is doing now is to plan ahead for more stringent measures, try them out, and prepare ourselves for when we actually need to implement them.

 

NUS must also prepare ourselves for more stringent measures that may have to be implemented. I would like to reiterate that all NUS Faculties, Schools, Research Institutes and Centres, and Offices must have their **Business Continuity Plans (BCP)** plans updated and in place. The objective is to ensure that all business operations remain fully functional at all at times; disruptions are minimised, and a high level of core activities will be business-as-usual, even if they are being conducted in different modes.

 

Given the escalating COVID-19 situation worldwide, with effect from 12 March 2020, a split-mode BCP arrangement has been implemented for the **Crisis Executive Group (CEG)** as follows:

 

|                       | **Team A (blue lanyards)**                                   | **Team B (orange lanyards)** |

Team members are to be physically segregated from members of the other team at all times, until further notice. This applies to social as well as official functions. Team A members should avoid meeting with colleagues in Team B in face-to-face meetings or over meals over prolonged periods, and vice-versa. Team A members are identified by their blue lanyards; Team B members, by their orange lanyards.

Operationally, there is no change to the protocols for all approvals and decision matrixes, or organisational structure, and the regular organisational processes and channels continue to apply.

I would also like to call for all mission-critical functions in NUS to activate and implement their BCPs, with immediate effect. BCPs can include different forms of social distancing measures, for example split-team mode, alternate or split worksite, telecommuting, etc. Mission-critical functions include the following:

 

|      | **Units**                                                    | **Applicable Staff**                                         |

| 5    | All other Administrative Offices (e.g. UCO etc.)             | UPR Office, NUS ETP Office, BOT Secretariat, OIA, ILO, UCO, GRO, OAR, DVO |

 

For all other units and staff, do ensure that your BCPs are in place and have been tested out, so that they can be implemented when needed.

 

I would like to reiterate that baseline precautionary measures, such as upholding high personal and public hygiene standards, daily temperature taking, travel declarations and e-learning for classes with more than 50 students, must continue to be adhered to, and this applies to the entire NUS community. All offices should also observe spacing (preferably at least 1m) between individuals in the work place at all times.

 

COVID-19 has demanded swift, decisive and innovative responses from the NUS community, and I am grateful that many of you have contributed to and rallied behind NUS’ efforts. As Singapore’s flagship public university, NUS is committed to working alongside national efforts in the fight against COVID-19, and to equip and prepare for various scenarios of disease transmission that may occur. Thank you for your hard work over the past nearly two months. 

 

It is an uncertain journey ahead, but with good plans and preparation, NUS will get through the COVID-19 situation. I look forward to your continued support. Thank you.

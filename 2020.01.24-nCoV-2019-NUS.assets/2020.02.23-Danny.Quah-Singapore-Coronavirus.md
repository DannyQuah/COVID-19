| subject: | NUS assignment? // The good story of Singapore's COVID-19 measures still needs to be written #dqWR-038773 |

Dear Eng Chye, Teck, colleagues -

This email is to get reactions and a sense of the temperature on whether at NUS we might, jointly, come up with a good, credible commentary to tell the world outside what Singapore's COVID-19 measures and public policy stance have been. The rest of this email goes into a bit of detail why I think this is needed, and why the items that have typically been referred to on this, within Singapore, might need further strengthening.

1. You have likely already seen this Wall Street Journal headline from a couple days ago: "How One Singapore Sales Conference Spread Coronavirus Around the World" https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-one-singapore-sales-conference-spread-coronavirus-around-the-world-11582299129 The article itself is, in the main line-by-line reasonable (in my view). But all that a casual reader will come away with is what appears to be the agency in Singapore's actions that have now "spread coronavirus around the world".

2. Within Singapore of course, everyone has direct personal experience with the COVID-19 measures, not least we at NUS. But what does the outside world know of these? That understanding is important not just for Singapore's ongoing international journey—on foreign policy, international trade, foreign investment, higher education—after COVID-19, but also for what lessons the rest of the global public understands of what Singapore is doing. By this I don't mean the technical scientific-medical responses, for which health professionals will have good communications already; I mean the general public.

3. Three principal items that, within Singapore, we have used to give us a sense of this. I find all three unsatisfactory; let me say why:

   1. Laurie Garrett in The Epoch Times interview.  Mothership.sg describes this as "[American science journalist praises Singapore's COVID-19 fight](https://mothership.sg/2020/02/laurie-garrett-singapore-covid-19/)" (if Singapore can't do it, we're all screwed). True, LG won a Pulitzer Prize for her account of the 1996 Ebola outbreak in Zaire; true, that she pointed to some key items in her account (Singapore has "got the best system in the world"). But, as I'd mentioned in our Senior Group, I don't think that the Epoch Times is the most credible outlet ordinary people out there will go to. Indeed, the first question in my head when my friends early on pointed this video out to me, *Why is the Epoch Times where Garrett is talking about this?* The Epoch Times is a group that has consistently propagandised anti-vaccination; it has spread conspiracy theories that the US Deep State (together with Clinton and Obama) are out to get Donald Trump; it has supported far-right politicians across Europe. While I want to point to what Garrett says on Singapore's measures, I'm uneasy doing that because I'm suggesting people go to the Epoch Times. (Also, further point: Garrett has consistently talked about the merits of wearing a surgical mask, which of course is not what Singapore policy has been.)
   2. Heijmans, Philip and Jason Gale. 2020. "[As Asia Panics, One Country Wins Praise for Approach to Virus](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-10/as-asia-panics-one-country-wins-praise-for-approach-to-virus)", *Bloomberg Politics* (10 Feb) https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-10/as-asia-panics-one-country-wins-praise-for-approach-to-virus
      1. I, along with everyone in the world who has seen it, found PM's recorded message the very model of good communication, and national leadership.
      2. Apart from PM's message, I don't see where Bloomberg Politics gets its headline.
      3. The article says "Singapore serves a model for other countries, say experts". Where? Which experts? The article itself contains no links to any such report.
   3. [Coronavirus detection in Singapore 'gold standard' for case detection: Harvard study](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-detection-in-singapore-gold-standard-for-case-detection-harvard-study), Straits Times (18 Feb 2020) https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-detection-in-singapore-gold-standard-for-case-detection-harvard-study  This describes the preprint "Quantifying bias of COVID-19 prevalence and severity estimates in Wuhan, China that depend on reported cases in international travelers", by Neihaus, De Salazar, Taylor, Lipsitch https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022707v2 doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022707
      1. A simple search with Google shows no significant international news outlet picking up this story. Outside of Singapore's own Straits Times.
      2. This is an unpublished paper that has not yet had referee reports on it used to assess its accuracy or its methodology.
      3. I cannot actually find the term "gold standard" used in the paper; although it could be that the search function on my PDF reader just isn't good enough.
      4. I read the paper. The paper does not say Singapore's approach is the best, but instead starts from the observation that Singapore's approach has shown "high sensitivity of case detection". The paper then uses Singapore's rate of case detection (as an upper limit in) a Bayesian statistical model that asks, What if other countries around the world achieved this same rate of case detection, what then would be the number of cases detected globally? How much of an under-estimation is there, comparing the actual number of cases reported, on the one hand, and, on the other, the number of cases if everywhere else detected cases at the same (upper limit) rate that Singapore has done?  (They then reckon the world has picked up only 38% of the cases it should have done, if in fact their model were correct; i.e., the true number of cases is likely 2.8x the number that has actually been detected.) This is an "as if" exercise; it is not a study of how objectively good [or bad] Singapore's approach is.

   None of this is to say that Singapore isn't doing well or even doing best in the world at this point.  (And certainly we can all use good news stories.) But, in my view, there's no authoritative internationally-received news media statement of Singapore's COVID-19 measures, despite what we've been told here in Singapore. There might be good accounts of these measures in recent JAMA and other technical publications, but it'll be science and medical professionals who see those. 

   My point and call to action in this email: Perhaps there's some value in putting out something that is authoritative and credible, targeted for mainstream news media, to be read by ordinary people around the world. This is something additional that NUS—combining our understanding of public health, clinical and government practice, public policy, and perhaps yet others—might be able to do. 

   If there are other takers, I'm happy to be part of a  group that writes up a short commentary on this, targeting perhaps the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal.

(2020.02.26 2307h) "We need to stop saying the response is 'gold standard'. We need to tell Singapore's story without undermining the credibility of our narrative."

Against the COVID-19 coronavirus, Singapore has done the best job imaginable. I&mdash;a nontechnical but reasonably well-read person&mdash;firmly believe this. There are many valuable public policy and scientific lessons here to unpack. But we need to stop saying the response is "gold standard". We need to tell Singapore's story without undermining the credibility of our narrative.

On Sun  09 Feb 2020 in a televised message to a worried nation, Singapore's Prime Minister provided a masterclass in informed, measured communication &mdash; how infection rates in what we now call COVID-19 might be high, but its mortality rate was low; how fear might cause greater harm than the virus itself; how good hygiene alone would go a long way to protect the people; how  government approach would adapt if the virus spread widely; how the population would be kept informed as events unfolded.

Indeed, the steps Singapore has taken to bring COVID-19 under control (and continues to carry out) have shown the same deft touch, authenticity, and effectiveness as appeared in the Prime Minister's speech. A complete story here still needs to be recounted, and I am confident the story will be a stirring one when it is told in detail.

However, some of the rhetoric being carried along in social (and some traditional) media on this journey is less helpful in maintaining credibility and authenticity.

1. There is constant reference to Harvard University's calling Singapore measures "gold standard". Such language has now appeared in a number of places. Problem is, that study undertaken by a team at Harvard nowhere carries such a declaration. Instead, what that paper does is note that Singapore's approach has shown "high sensitivity of case detection". The paper takes as given that rate of case detection (as an upper limit in) a Bayesian statistical model that asks, What if other countries around the world achieved this same rate of case detection, what then would be global detection on the number of cases? The authors reckon that if their model were correct, the world has picked up only 38% of the cases it should have done, i.e., the true number of cases is likely 2.8x the number that has actually been detected. This is a striking finding. But it is also, in every meaningful sense of the term, an "if-then" spreadsheet calculation. Having "high sensitivity of case detection" is not the goal of policy or science; instead, the goal is to get the most accurate case detection. (You can get 100% call-out on cases by just declaring everyone infected. That 100%, however, cannot even remotely be a satisfactory rate of case detection. Basic statistical theory cautions, Type 1 and Type 2 errors.) The Harvard study is not a study that passes judgment on how objectively good [or bad] Singapore's approach is. We need to stop saying Harvard University has declared Singapore's measures 'gold standard'. 
2. There is reference to a Laurie Garrett interview that Mothership.sg subsequently describes as "[American science journalist praises Singapore's COVID-19 fight](https://mothership.sg/2020/02/laurie-garrett-singapore-covid-19/)" ('if Singapore can't do it, we're all screwed').  True, Ms Garrett can potentially provide a powerful voice; she had won a Pulitzer Prize for her account of the 1996 Ebola outbreak in Zaire. True, Ms Garrett pointed to some key items in her account with which I heartily agree (Singapore has "got the best system in the world"). She also did say there was merit to wearing a surgical mask, but I can let that pass. However, what is harder to let go of is that this was an interview that appeared in The Epoch Times.  Yes, the same Epoch Times that that has consistently propagandised anti-vaccination; the one that spreads conspiracy theories that the US Deep State (together with Hilary Clinton and Obama) are out to get Donald Trump; the same Epoch Times that has supported far-right politicians across Europe. I am getting distinct mixed messages here, and I don't know that we should be using an interview like this to talk up how Singapore has done against the 2019 coronavirus.

We need to tell the Singapore story right in this battle against COVID-19.  That story is one of foresighted preparedness, and making the right decisions under pressure. It is a story of hardworking scientists and rigorous modeling, dramatic medical breakthroughs, and sheer hard slog (contact tracing, without drawing on full-blown AI). 

But that we tell the story with credibility, authority, and accuracy&mdash;not with hyperbole and fake news&mdash;will be what bears confident and assured witness to the brave valiant work that has been done here in Singapore.  And that story is one that remains still to be written.

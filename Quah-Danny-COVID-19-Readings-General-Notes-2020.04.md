### General

(2020.04.18 1700h) Derek Thompson. 2020. [The Economy is Ruined](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/economy-ruined-it-didnt-have-be-way/609334/), The Atlantic (02 Apr) https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/economy-ruined-it-didnt-have-be-way/609334/

- 10mn new unemployed only two weeks (3.3mn, then 6.6mn). In the US, you lose job, you lose unemployment insurance. 

- “In the early innings of the crisis, it was obvious that the forced closure of city streets would be an apocalypse-level event for restaurants, the travel industry, concerts, amusement parks, and any other company in the business of attracting a crowd.”
  Social distancing, hand washing, etc, will slow commerce. “But the economic stoppage is now rippling into almost every sector of the economy. When restaurants and stores cannot open, they can’t order new supplies. When farms can’t supply restaurants with food, they can’t afford new equipment. Without new equipment orders, manufacturers have to lay off workers.”
- DT thinks the choice is between subsidising firms and workers so the latter remain employed, on the one hand, and on the other laying off and then paying unemployment insurance. DQ:  But not all else equal, transmission and infection in the first much worse?

Haas, Richard. 2020. "The Pandemic Will Accelerate History Rather Than Reshape It", Foreign Affairs (07 Apr)

https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-04-07/pandemic-will-accelerate-history-rather-reshape-it

- Not every crisis is a turning point (vs my preferred "A crisis is a terrible thing to waste."), despite most analysts suggesting the world will be fundamentally different:

  - New world order led by China vs demise of China's putative global leadership
  - End of globalisation vs new era of global cooperation
  - "Supercharge nationalism, undermine free trade". Regime change

- Critical factors for recovery

  1. Hygiene and social distancing followed by populations;
  2. Quick, accurate, affordable testing; antiviral drugs, vaccine;
  3. Economic relief for people and businesses.

  "Globalization is a reality, not a choice"

Karabell, Zachary. 2020. "[Can History’s Biggest Stimulus Stave Off a Coronavirus Depression?](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-04-16/can-historys-biggest-stimulus-stave-coronavirus-depression)", Foreign Affairs (16 Apr)

- In 1934 Keynes's criticism of Roosevelt's New Deal was that it wasn't enough, that government needed "to dramatically increase spending and allow for higher deficits". Roosevelt didn't budge but kept government spending to come out at about US\$700bn (in today's dollars) over the entire period.  Other programs (UK's National Health System; the Nordic countries, and then the rest of Europe; Lyndon Johnson's Great Society programs) worldwide would eventually come to trillions of US dollars, but came in over decades.
- Reagan-Thatcher withdrew.
- But then 2008 GFC led to the US government bailing out banking, insurance, auto industries US\$800bn, then approved stimulus package similar size (and the Fed engaged into quantitative easing); EU bailout less than US\$300bn.
- COVID-19 pandemic has led to the US government authorising spending one third of annual GDP in months. Within weeks in March and up to mid-Apr, together with the Fed, more than US\$6tn injected into US economy. Similarly in Europe  and ECB. Direct subsidy of private payrolls (Norway, Italy, France, UK). China, Japan, Republic of Korea had led the way.

"... an experiment in hyper-Keynesiasm so large the best analogy comes from military doctrine": Overwhelming force

1. Does excessive spending financed by monetary expansion cause hyper-inflation?  Zimbabwe
2. Does excessive government intervention lead to excesses and lowered economic growth? 
3. Is there still a threshold debt-GDP ratio above which economies perform badly? Japan's 230%: sure anemic growth but also economic stability, low inflation, widely-shared affluence. 

Green, Michael and Medeiros, Evan. 2020. "[The Pandemic Won’t Make China the World’s Leader](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-04-15/pandemic-wont-make-china-worlds-leader)", Foreign Affairs (15 Apr)

- *Few Countries Are Buying the Model or the Message From Beijing*

(2020.04.19 1730h) The Economist 18 Apr 2020

- "Is China Winning?"
- "Fumbling for the Exit Strategy" // Hard vs Soft Lockdown
- "Creating Immunity to COVID-19"
  1. Phase I to Phase III trials typically take 18 months; Ebola at 10 months was the fastest.
  2. Antigen - provokes the body to generate antibodies and other immune responses. Infected cells display antigens to draw attention of the body's immune system. This produces antibodies to fight the viral infection.
  3. Antibodies are proteins that stick to antigens, preventing further infection and tagging virus particles for destruction.  Antibodies take time to respond. COVID-19 patients only start producing antibodies in second week of symptoms showing.
  4. Pre genetic engineering, doctors exposed those seeking treatment in three distinct ways
     1. **Live-attenuated vaccine** [i.e., a disabled virus]. Examples include measles, mump, rubella.
     2. **Inactivated virus**. Examples include Salk polio and seasonal-flu vaccines.
     3. The **antigen itself**. Taken from infected blood, e.g., Hepatitis B vaccine
  5. With genetic engineering, other methods now possible
- However, key: vaccine profits are low. Yes, pandemic but those have a way of vanishing quickly. Not many profit-driven (Western pharmaceutical) companies end up producing vaccines. The capabilities are concentrated in just four: GSK, Johnson and Johnson, Pfizer, and Sanofi, and they are all wary of developing vaccines for pandemics. When the pandemic is over, so too does the market vanish and profits along with that.

Koh, Tommy. 2020. "[Letter to my grandchildren in a time of pandemic](https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/letter-to-my-grandchildren-in-a-time-of-pandemic)", Straits Times (18 Apr) https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/letter-to-my-grandchildren-in-a-time-of-pandemic

Mohan, Raja C. 2020. "[WHO and the war over global institutions](https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/who-and-the-war-over-global-institutions)", Straits Times (17 Apr) https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/who-and-the-war-over-global-institutions

- League of Nations vs Comintern, or Communist International, after Soviet Russia was denied entry into the League. Both failed from nationalism, sovereignty, WW2, and the fears of "world government"
- United Nations consciously avoided illusion of collective security
- Concert of major powers in the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. But then WW2's victors over Germany and Japan couldn't agree on anything either through the Cold War. NATO vs Warsaw Pact; Bretton Woods institutions vs Comecon (the Soviets' Council for Mutual Economic Assistance)
- After collapse of Soviet Union, Moscow took cooperative approach, and Beijing quietly low-profiled around multilateral forums.  Both Russia and China turned to capitalism.
- But then US unilaterally Middle East; Russia and China  BRICs-ed; the latter especially grew and ran trade surpluses, implicitly challenging the US for economic supremacy. US backlash against globalisation and free trade, together with fears that Beijing was undermining US primacy. The first suggested, at least to the Americans, economic decoupling; the second some alternative pushback.
- 1990s cooperative multilateralism transformed into competitive multilateralism
- Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, against US hegemony in Eurasia. Russia Collective Security Treaty Organisation (for former Soviet republics). US "Quad" &mdash; four major democracies, US, India, Japan, Australia.
- Russia might be building political and security groupings, but China has focused on the economic: New Development Bank or BRICs bank based in Shanghai. AIIB in Beijing.  China's Belt and Road Initiative, the single largest economic framework outside Bretton Woods
- China's is the "far more sweeping challenge to the US, and more broadly, the prolonged Western domination of the institutions of multilateralism and the discourse shaping them."

Bilahari, Kausikan. 2020. "[Reports of the death of liberal international order are exaggerated](https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/reports-of-the-death-of-liberal-international-order-are-exaggerated)", Straits Times (06 Apr)

"When this pandemic ends, irrespective of the final number of fatalities, I doubt that the relative balance of power or relations between the US and China will be altered in any fundamental way. Covid-19 is not nuclear war or the medieval black plague. Its strategic effect, if any, will be marginal."

- Domestic interests. In a crunch, all countries look to themselves first.
- Economic impact: vulnerabilities of over-reliance on (Chinese) supply chains.  But difficulty getting replacement. Turning inward likely.
- "The period when that order was unchallenged was historically exceptional and short, only about two decades from 1989 when the Berlin Wall came down, to the global financial crisis. For half of the 20th century and almost all of the period since the second decade of the 21st century, international order was divided and contested. The pandemic may well catalyse a return to such a more historically normal order. That is a serious enough situation but not the same thing as a collapse of the existing order."

(2020.04.20 1100h) Chan Heng Chee. 2020. "[Urgent need for multilateral action and global leadership](https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/urgent-need-for-multilateral-action-and-global-leadership)", Straits Times (14 Apr)

- Virus spread facilitated by globalisation
- Urbanisation: Density efficiency vs health security
- Role of governments
- Global, multilateral response needed
  - US and China should "pause their ideological and strategic rivalry and work together to deal with this once-in-a-century pandemic that impacts all of mankind."

Bottom line: "It is too soon to tell what the world will look like after Covid-19. I belong to the school that does not see a great transformation taking place. Some things will change. Geopolitical trends will be fluid and accelerated. Multilateralism will not be the new order of the day."



Kishore Mahbubani. 2020. "[Can humanity make U-turns?](https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/can-humanity-make-u-turns)", Straits Times (09 Apr) https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/can-humanity-make-u-turns

- "The coronavirus pandemic has underlined the importance of supporting multilateral organisations like the World Health Organisation, rather than progressively weakening them."

- Multilateralism

- Constant weakening of WHO

- "As friends of the West, we should work with and encourage them to speak out more. We should tell them that the fate of the human species depends on our ability to make essential U-turns and work together to strengthen, not weaken, institutions of good governance, like the WHO.

  This will be a key litmus test to assess whether humanity is truly the most intelligent species on planet Earth."

Linda Lim. 2020. "[The end of Ideology?](https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/the-end-of-ideology)", Straits Times (08 Apr) https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/the-end-of-ideology

- "Stimulus packages giving direct handouts to millions have made mainstream what would once be considered radical. Meanwhile, the pandemic is sparking renewed innovation and community spirit. The world post-Covid-19 will be different - and perhaps better."

- "As an economist, the most striking thing to me about national governments' policy responses to the Covid-19 crisis is how quickly all have shed long-held ideologies about the role of government, and especially government spending."

- End of globalisation?

- Enhanced innovation

- Enhanced social safety nets

- Enhanced community engagement

- Bottom line: "When the crisis abates, global economic growth will probably be permanently lower.

  But with more equitable resource distribution, greater social security, a cleaner environment (reduced transport, travel and congestion), better health (less pollution, more home cooking), perhaps even closer family relations fostered by social distancing, friendship bonds through social media, and enhanced community spirit, the future, though different, need not be worse than the past."

Hugh White. 2020. "[Covid-19 will accelerate America's eclipse by China](https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/covid-19-will-accelerate-americas-eclipse-by-china)", Straits Times (07 Apr) https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/covid-19-will-accelerate-americas-eclipse-by-china

- "The damage done by the pandemic to the US economy and its soft power is part of a longer-term shift in power between the two rivals."
- Humanity over-estimates the impact of the short-term, and under-estimates the effects of the longer-run.
- "The pandemic has delivered a crushing blow to its reputation as an efficient, effective society with a clear capacity to care for its own people, and to take the lead globally in responding to major challenges. The reason America has been so hard hit is that it handled the early stages of the pandemic so badly." "[...] far from leading an effective global response, America has become an example of what not to do in the most traumatic global crisis in living memory."
- "the pandemic should make us at last take seriously what the long-term trends have been telling us for a long time now. Asia faces a future without America, and we need to start thinking hard about what to do about it."

Zheng, Yongnian. 2020. "[The three lessons China should learn to avert another crisis](https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/the-three-lessons-china-should-learn-to-avert-another-crisis)", Straits Times (11 Apr) 

- Others grappling with COVID-19 "might look on with envy at China's success in reining in the disease."  "[...] by March 10, when President Xi visited Wuhan, the [epicentre of the outbreak](http://https//www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/wuhan-virus-inside-chinas-ground-zero-unease-grips-a-city-in-lockdown), it was clear that China had overcome the health crisis and was on the road to recovery."
- "whole-nation approach"; draconian community and business lockdowns 
- YZ's three key lessons:
  1. Relationship between central leadership and local government: Buck passing because of centralisation
  2. Relationship between provinces: Checkpoint row between Jiangxi and Hubei police, after Beijing had lifted travel restrictions on Hubei residents. Jiangxi officials disagreed; Jiangxi police tried to stop Hubei people from crossing into their province.
  3. Relationship between government/party and the people.

Bottom line: "Let society play a role in motivating and constraining local governments and their officials. Centralisation of power may seem a faster, more streamlined way of managing modern-day China. But as the Covid-19 pandemic shows, without timely intervention from diverse players, a small outbreak in a tiny corner of Wuhan can end up having devastating global consequences."

CNN. 2020. "[In 1911, another epidemic swept through China. That time, the world came together](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/18/china/great-manchurian-plague-china-hnk-intl/index.html)" (19 Apr) https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/18/china/great-manchurian-plague-china-hnk-intl/index.html

"The purpose of the conference was to find the cause of the outbreak, learn which suppression techniques were most effective, discover why the disease had spread so far so fast, and assess what could be done to prevent a second wave. While the conference was not without some finger pointing, it was mostly a genuine attempt to learn.
As the world now faces a pandemic characterized by a lack of a globally co-ordinated response and multilateral effort on the part of political leaders, the collaborative aspects of the 1911 conference in north-eastern China are worth reconsidering.
Today, the World Health Organization (WHO) appears compromised, the virus has been racialized, major nations are angry with each other and competing for resources and control of the narrative, while poorer countries are left to fend largely for themselves.
Compared to 1911, we appear a polarized and divided world."

The Economist. 2020. "[Rich countries try radical economic policies to counter covid-19](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/03/26/rich-countries-try-radical-economic-policies-to-counter-covid-19)" (26 Mar)

- Risk in the economy is there for a reason, "No one cheers when a firm goes bust, but often the process helps shift resources from less efficient to more efficient uses, thus raising productivity and average living standards over time. The novel notion that the government needs to preserve firms, jobs and workers’ incomes at practically any cost may endure, especially if the intervention proves successful in narrow terms."
- Bottom line: "The likely economic effects of the pandemic reach far beyond the role of the state. Countries could become even less welcoming to immigrants—the better, they may believe, to reduce the likelihood of infection from foreign arrivals. On the same logic, resistance to the development of dense urban centres could mount, thereby limiting construction of new housing and raising costs. More countries may seek to become self-sufficient in the production of “strategic” commodities such as medicines, medical equipment and even toilet roll, contributing to a further rollback of globalisation. But the redefined role of the state could prove to be the most significant shift. The rules of the game have been moving in one direction for centuries. Another radical change is looming."

- "The task ahead is to build economies and societies that are more durable, and more humanly habitable, than those that were exposed to the anarchy of the global market."
- "This does not mean a shift to small-scale localism. Human numbers are too large for local self-sufficiency to be viable, and most of humankind is not willing to return to the small, closed communities of a more distant past. But the hyperglobalisation of the last few decades is not coming back either."
- "A situation in which so many of the world’s essential medical supplies originate in China – or any other single country – will not be tolerated. Production in these and other sensitive areas will be re-shored as a matter of national security."
- "[...] what will replace rising material living standards as the basis of society?"
- "What is fast unravelling is not only the hyperglobalisation of recent decades but the global order set in place at the end of the Second World War. Puncturing an imaginary equilibrium, the virus has hastened a process of disintegration that has been under way for many years."
- "Being shielded from danger has trumped freedom from interference by government."

- Overlooked clusters of migrant workers living in cramped dormitories "and an underestimation of the speed at which those infections could spread through a city where lockdown measures had not been put in place".
- Early on, testing widely, isolating those even only potentially contagious, Singapore kept relatively open and continued functioning as normal
- In contrast, HK, lockdown was stricter: public schools had been closed since Feb and government employees encouraged to work from home. Increase in imported cases 

Nikkei Asian Review. 2020. "[Singapore's coronavirus spike sends world a wake-up call](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/Singapore-s-coronavirus-spike-sends-world-a-wake-up-call)" (20 Apr)

"Low-paid migrant workers remain acutely vulnerable to human rights abuses that increase their risk of infection from COVID-19," rights groups said in a joint letter to the UAE government dated April 10. "These include crowded labor accommodations and inequitable access to medical care and health insurance, and immigration detention centers and prisons that have often been found to hold detainees in cramped, dismal and unhygienic conditions."

Japan, too, has tens of thousands of what it calls "technical intern trainees" -- de facto low-cost labor -- from countries like Vietnam and China. Thailand hosts over 1 million workers from Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia. Though living conditions vary by country, these workers tend to occupy a weak position in society.

Migrant workers are not the only ones at increased risk. In the U.S., research suggests low-income individuals in general are over-represented among COVID-19 cases.



I'm concerned about an emerging narrative out there taking two different lines: They are  folded into the single statement: "foreign workers are inappropriately mistreated in Singapore; this has now rebounded to change a gold-standard success story into instead a cautionary tale".  

Take these two in turn. First, foreign workers:

Instead of  the "Foreign" in "FWs crowded into dormitories", the key feature is that this vulnerable population lives in close quarters, under conditions that disallow appropriate social distancing. It is not just foreign workers that have to live like this. 

I'm not saying that how they live is is right; I am saying that the "foreign" part of "foreign workers" sends a misleading message, for both Singapore and other nations.

In other parts of the world, this Third Wave (the second wave being imported cases) will soon almost surely emerge. These won't be places with crowded FW dormitories but where there are similar features under a different name: cities with packed favelas, slums, and crowded and decrepit public housing.  Some examples of course will still be of foreign workers: Japan has thousands of "technical intern trainees" from Vietnam and China; Thailand, over 1mn workers from poorer nations around it. But Brazil, the US, and the UK, among many other nations have vulnerable domestic populations living in terrible urban slums and low-cost public housing. 

That Third Wave is almost surely imminent. The key common characteristic is how societies treat their poor and vulnerable, not whether that group is foreign or otherwise. My impression is that in this COVID-19 outbreak Singapore has, by all accounts, treated its foreign workers in exemplary fashion. [This is different from how these FWs had to live previously, indeed in crowded dormitories.]

Second, there is an implicit assumption in the "What's happened now in Singapore?" discussions. That is that Singapore has misjudged the speed and spread of infections in a city where more stringent lockdowns were not put in place. 

This, however, is skewed and arguably misleading when excessive attention is paid only to the headline figures (19 Apr 2020) "[596 new cases bring Singapore's total to 6588](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/596-new-covid-19-infections-confirmed-in-spore-majority-work-permit-holders-in-dorms)", without seeing that "Of the 596 new cases, 544 were work permit holders residing in dormitories. Only 25 are Singaporeans or permanent residents. There were no imported cases." 

(Today, of course, that headline number is "1426, bringing the total to 8014" - don't know yet the breakdown across WP holders in dormitories.)

If 91% of 600 cases is clustered in an understandable, manageable way, that is a very different picture from where 600 new cases are running rampant across the island randomly infecting different, dispersed parts of the population.

The question is how to communicate this without appearing to blame the victim even more.

Beech, Hannah. 2020. "[Singapore Seemed to Have Coronavirus Under Control, Until Cases Doubled](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/world/asia/coronavirus-singapore.html)", New York Times (20 Apr)

"The spread suggests that it is unrealistic for the United States, Europe and the rest of the world to return to the way they were anytime soon, even if viral curves appear to flatten."

- "Singapore did almost everything right. // After recording its first coronavirus case on Jan. 23, the prosperous city-state [meticulously traced](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/world/asia/coronavirus-singapore-hong-kong-taiwan.html) the close contacts of every infected patient, while keeping a sense of normalcy on its streets. Borders were shut to populations likely to carry the contagion, although businesses stayed open. Ample testing and treatment were free for residents."
- "Vulnerable populations, such as migrants, cannot be ignored."
- "With cases proliferating, Singapore abandoned its strategy of maintaining a semblance of normal life. Schools were closed on April 8, and residents are now required to wear face masks in public."
- "Hundreds of thousands of foreign workers have been quarantined in their cramped quarters, with testing among them turning up hundreds of new cases a day."
- "While arrivals at Singapore’s climate-controlled airport, with its butterfly gardens and orchid displays, were closely monitored for the coronavirus, the contagion was spreading in government-built dormitories crowded with 200,000 foreign laborers, mostly from South Asia and China. // The first low-wage foreign workers tested positive for the coronavirus in February, and their close contacts were quarantined and tested, according to the Singaporean authorities. [...] Most of the cases are mild or asymptomatic and none so far have required critical care, according to the government, perhaps explaining why the spread among the foreign-worker population was not caught earlier."
- "Other countries that managed to limit the pandemic within their borders are also struggling with recurrences. [China has reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/world/asia/china-wuhan-coronavirus-death-toll.html) an uptick in imported infections, while increased testing has uncovered [more cases in Japan](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/world/asia/japan-coronavirus-emergency.html)."
- Three waves: "As visitors from China brought the virus to Singapore in January, the Singaporean authorities quickly banned flights from affected areas. The police helped find close contacts of those who tested positive. People returning from ski holidays in Europe or jaunts to New York sat out their quarantines in fancy hotels. // When a second wave of imported cases appeared from Europe and North America, Singapore barred all short-term foreign visitors. Everyone who returns to the island undergoes mandatory quarantine. For more than a week now, there has been only one imported case of the coronavirus. // But the rapid spread of the virus among foreign laborers was a clear lapse in the stringent epidemic planning, which was strengthened after Singapore was hit hard by the SARS virus in 2003."

(Bloomberg) Sweden says its controversial coronavirus strategy proving effective, Straits Times (20 Apr 2020) https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/sweden-says-its-controversial-coronavirus-strategy-proving-effective

"... given the huge economic damage caused by strict lockdowns, the Swedish approach has drawn considerable interest around the world.

Part of that approach relies on having access to one of the world's best-functioning healthcare systems. At no stage did Sweden see a real shortage of medical equipment or hospital capacity, and tents set up as emergency care facilities around the country have mostly remained empty."

"[...] some Swedish characteristics that may be helping the country deal with the current crisis. More than half of Swedish households are single-person, making social distancing easier to carry out. More people work from home than anywhere else in Europe, and everyone has access to fast Internet, which helps large chunks of the workforce stay productive away from the office.

And while many other countries have introduced strict laws, including hefty fines if people are caught breaching newly minted social-distancing laws, Swedes appear to be following such guidelines without the need for legislation. Trips from Stockholm to Gotland - a popular vacation destination - dropped by 96 per cent over the Easter weekend, according to data from the country's largest mobile operator, Telia Company. And online service Citymapper's statistics indicate an almost 75 per cent drop in mobility in the capital.

Sweden also recently pushed back against the notion that there's little to no social distancing going on.

"We don't have a radically different view," Foreign Minister Ann Linde said in an interview with Radio Sweden. "The government has made a series of decisions that affect the whole society. It's a myth that life goes on as normal in Sweden.""

- Epidemiological curve vs recession curve

- "Unable to provide the care that people need to survive, overwhelmed hospitals result in more people dying than would be the case with a slower rate of infection. Reducing the rate of infection is thus a life-and-death imperative."

- "Given the lack of testing in Europe and the US, the only way to keep the sick and healthy apart is to keep everyone apart. And that produces a recession."

- "Because COVID-19 is very infectious but not particularly lethal, the disease itself would have caused a slowdown, but probably not a very large one. The bulk of the coming recession is being caused by the public health measures taken to calm human calamity at the hospitals. 

  Governments are preventing workers from working (deepening the supply-side recession) and consumers from consuming (deepening the demand-side recession). The recession, in other words, is intentional and unavoidable. "

"Donald Trump launched an extraordinary attack on the agency, putting $500 million in funding on hold while an investigation is conducted into its handling of the pandemic. 

Mr Trump singled out what he called the WHO's 'dangerous and costly decision' to argue against international travel bans to combat the pandemic.

The US State Department added the agency was too late in sounding the alarm over Covid-19 and is overly deferential to China.

It questioned why it did not pursue a lead from Taiwan flagged up on December 31 about reports of atypical pneumonia in Wuhan."

(2020.05.09 1700h) Rudd, Kevin. 2020. [The Murdoch media’s China coronavirus conspiracy has one aim: get Trump re-elected](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/08/murdoch-media-china-coronavirus-conspiracy-trump-kevin-rudd), The Guardian (Fri 08 May)

'The sheer magnitude of the damage means that the people of the world have every right to know how this came about. Whether China’s new class of “wolf warrior” diplomats care to recognise it or not, there are fundamental questions we can all legitimately demand answers to." Among these:

1. the origin of the virus in Wuhan; 
2. whether the earliest genetic evidence of the outbreak has been properly preserved for independent research; 
3. the danger of [wildlife “wet markets”](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/how-did-the-coronavirus-start-where-did-it-come-from-how-did-it-spread-humans-was-it-really-bats-pangolins-wuhan-animal-market) in the transmission of such viruses; 
4. what delays occurred in notifying central authorities; 
5. why some local medical staff were either [silenced or punished](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/07/coronavirus-chinese-rage-death-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang); 
6. what delay occurred in notifying the World Health Organization of human-to-human transmission, given China’s obligations under the relevant international health regulations;
7. whether the WHO properly discharged its mandate to provide clear and early warnings to the international community;
8. whether national governments took all necessary actions to prepare for the virus reaching their own shores, or whether these warnings were effectively ignored – as appears to have been the case in the US.

But now unilateral declaration by Trump and Pompeo on "the body of evidence [overwhelmingly points to the virus having leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/mike-pompeo-donald-trump-coronavirus-chinese-laboratory), where research projects have been under way into various categories of coronavirus borne by bats".

The Guardian. 2020. "[Mike Pompeo: 'enormous evidence' coronavirus came from Chinese lab](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/mike-pompeo-donald-trump-coronavirus-chinese-laboratory)" (03 May)

"Beijing has rejected the suggestion the virus could have escaped from a laboratory. But Chinese authorities have not allowed foreign experts, including investigators from the World Health Organization, to take part in the investigation into the origins of the virus. Nor have they shared samples taken from wild animals at the Wuhan livestock market where they claim the outbreak began."

Martin Jacques. 2006. "[America the pressure cooker](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/dec/30/politics) (review of Robert Kagan, Dangerous Nation)", The Guardian (30 Dec)

- Relentless expansionism of the American empire from early on
- Narrative could not rely on roots nor the past [they had none but had to manufacture]
- Not just ethnic cleansing but ethnic extermination (same as Australia)

The Economist. 2020. "[The White House v covid-19](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/04/11/the-white-house-v-covid-19)" (11 Apr)

- Early on, Trump's insistence COVID-19 less serious than seasonal flu
- State Governors have been bidding against one another for medical protective equipment
- Trump administration shelved January 2017 plans from previous governments to make cheaper ventilators and 20m reusable face masks
- China's exports of medical equipment to the US: 
  - Chinese firms might be sued if standards insufficient or not met;
  - trade war: Trump barring exports of medical equipment at the same time federal government seeking to secure supplies from abroad

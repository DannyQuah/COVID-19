Mulheirn, Ian; Alvis, Sam; Insall, Lizzie; Browne, James; and Palmou, Christina. 2020. "A Sustainable Exit Strategy: Managing Uncertainty, Minimising Harm", Policy Futures, Tony Blair Institute for Global Change (20 Apr)

- Basic tradeoff: Lockdown, stringency save lives, buy time vs GDP decline and other health costs if lockdown continues
- Easing alone could set off another wave of infection.
- Twin-track strategy to minimise the tradeoff &mdash; to prevent deaths and acceleration of the number of cases. Easing with Suppression; Containment (masks, testing, tracing); Shielding (protect older people)
  - Segmentation: schools; age segmentation; sector segmentation (workplaces more and less risky); geographic segmentation (caseloads and capacity differential)

No vaccines or treatments yet, so any sustainable lockdown exit needs some strategy for containment and shielding.

Uncertainty: 1. Long-term economic damage; 2. Mental health concerns; 3. Erodes support for lockdown.

Government needs a contingency exit plan, for businesses and families to plan for the future.

1. In UK, expect 35% GDP decline if lockdown continues through June 2020; unemployment to rise (2mn) to 10%. What will be the permanent damage to the economy - highly uncertain, but likely rising the longer lockdown continues.
2. Lockdown hits lower-income hardest. Sectors most shutdown are also those where wages are lowest [contrast finance and insurance, high wages but barely touched, with food and accommodations, low wages but highly affected]
3. Educational disparities
4. Health impact: excess cancer deaths; non-COVID-19 respiratory visits declined by 75% from 16 Mar 2020 distancing introduction. A&E. Heart attacks.

Against social distancing:

1. COVID-19 doesn't seem to spread faster in dense urban areas in the UK
2. Qian et al study on China, transmission mostly within home or public transportation

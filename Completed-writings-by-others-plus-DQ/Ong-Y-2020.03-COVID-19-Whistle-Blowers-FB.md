"[...] role of Dr Li Wen Liang. As a matter of fact, he was not the main nor the earliest doctor who reported a new sars-like pneumonia to relevant authorities in China--that was Dr Zhang and she was not censured nor obstructed at all." Ok this part was taken from various sources over the months. Give me a minute to get the sources about Dr Zhang jixian.

Under this link (dated Feb 8th) I have collected information on Dr Zhang Jixian. Under the comments I have an article translated from Chinese that contains details about Dr Zhang's actions in the early days.

> As I see it: The tragic death of Dr. Li Wenliang will be mourned by all people of goodwill. But his death should not be exploited by those who have a grudge against China or its government. What is a tragedy? It is when good people are struck down by events beyond their control.
>
> Dr. Li and seven others first sounded the alert about the 2019-nCoV. They didn't know what it was at the time but had suspicions that it could be a SARS-like viral disease. They went public with their concerns and were criticized and sanctioned for doing so. They did not go through established reporting procedures set up to avoid false alarms which could generate panic among the public.
>
> It took three weeks before the outbreak was officially recognized and measures were taken to combat it. By that time the virus was well-established and had been widely disseminated, leading to the current epidemic. The doctors have since been exonerated and the local officials who criticized them excoriated.
>
> But if their warnings had been heeded would the virus have been stemmed? Most likely not. Could actions have been taken to better prepare for its onslaught? Perhaps. But again, probably not. It is human nature to delay until forced to respond. Once it was established that a coronavirus was rampantly spreading the government at all levels went into high gear. The proactive measures employed have impressed and astonished all people of goodwill.
>
> But there are those who will use the tragedy of Dr. Li, who eventually succumbed to the virus while fighting it on the front lines, as a weapon to defame and discredit China and its leaders. They forget that the US response to the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic was far tardier. It took the US months before declaring a medical emergency during which thousands died. How many may have lived if the proper preventative measures had been taken? But no one seems to remember that.
>
> The critics of China have no real concern for the Chinese people. They are a vindictive lot who love to engage in schadenfreude, taking cynical pleasure in others' misfortune and exploiting it for their own benefit and profit.

Caixin Global 07 Feb 2020 interview with Li Wenliang on 30 Jan https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-02-07/whistleblower-doctor-who-died-fighting-coronavirus-only-wanted-people-to-know-the-truth-101512578.html





More on Dr Zhang fr People's Daily.

From China Daily.

This is a critical investigation of possible delays in the initial events, picking out various irregularities and alleged suppressions.

Nonetheless, it does not dispute the major timelines including when Dr Zhang discovered and reported the strange pneumonias.

The article said,  quote: "As early as Dec. 27, a Guangzhou-based genomics company had sequenced most of the virus from fluid samples from the lung of a 65-year old deliveryman who worked at the seafood market where many of the first cases emerged. The results showed an alarming similarity to the deadly SARS coronavirus that killed nearly 800 people between 2002 and 2003. Around that time, local doctors sent at least eight other patient samples from hospitals around Wuhan to multiple Chinese genomics companies, including industry heavyweight BGI, as they worked to determine what was behind a growing number of cases of unexplained respiratory disease. The results all pointed to a dangerous SARS-like virus. That was days before China notified the World Health Organization (WHO) on Dec. 31 about the emergence of an unidentified infectious disease, two weeks before it shared the virus’s genome sequence with the world, and crucially, more than three weeks before Chinese authorities confirmed publicly that the virus was spreading between people.

This is Dr Zhang Jixian, interviewed on CGTN last Saturday!

Couple arrested for allegedly leaking press release on Covid-19 school closures

Imo, what Dr Li Wenliang did was something like this ![☝🏻](2020.03-Yanny.Ong-COVID-19-Whistle-Blowers-FB.assets/261d_1f3fb.png), he leaked 'classified' info when authorities have not decided to inform the wider community and the public yet. And Dr Li was not even 'arrested'; he was called up by police and asked to sign a confession for what he did. 

But western media cried bloody murder and enlarged his  role to scream 'cover-up'! 

(Altho' I don't blame what he did; he just wanted to help keep his med classmates safe by urging them to take precautions in case it turned out to be something like sars. Someone from his closed group must have leaked it out and it got to the police) 

And for the medical team working in the FW Dorms now in Sgp, there are very strict rules against photography and videography. So now what? If this is China the western press will scream 'cover-up' too!

I don't even blame Central Govt for the so-called 6-days 'delay' before informing the public.  During the 6-days, gov and hospitals all over were scrambling in preparation for the public announcement and the measures that will be implemented when it was announced.  The large banquet in Wuhan was not cancelled during the 6 days and was blamed for delaying the epidemic control. Whether or not it was an oversight or it was deliberated on, there can be arguments on the pros and cons. Imagine if the Wuhan officials cancelled the banquet. Word will leak out before the authorities were prepared for a shut-down, and it could have triggered a massive exodus from Wuhan bigger than those who did managed to leave Wuhan before the lockdown.  Given that Wuhan was going to be locked-down, those who attended the banquet and if they caught the virus would still be confined within Wuhan (theoretically) after the lockdown was implemented.

what western media cry as 'cover-up', in a western jurisdiction, would just be 'classified information' imo!

I did a [timeline of events](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YSgpg5yzPDUAsTAR26q3ulvwKxF3_X7fK-CBbtLILgA/edit?fbclid=IwAR2neJS4ugeaPPX94SFGZedwqbW8JI8yaUtoqmre2WrLHOE4icVeQzoPQaM) (Google Docs, but also DQ saved as 2020.03-Yanny.Ong-COVID-19-TIMELINE-WUHAN.odt) in Wuhan/Hubei from information dug up by NYT, AP and Caixin. 

Here it is and this is the worst that adversarial media could come up with despite all intentions to dig up dirt. Looks pretty decent to me actually. 

What China hawks are alleging as ‘cover-ups’ are just activities that western governments may call ‘classified’ or 'embargoed' if the same were to happen to them, imo.

I did screencaps of the interview, to capture the English subtitles. The screencaps are in the comments under my  post here:

https://www.facebook.com/yanny.ong.357/posts/10158096806632487

Now that I think about it, just from the perspective of preventing a massive panic and Wuhanites escaping to all corners of the world, is a good enough reason for the 6-days' so-called 'delay' before the Central Govt publicized their suspicions about the transmission of the virus!

(2020.04.18 1700h) Derek Thompson. 2020. The Economy is Ruined, The Atlantic (02 Apr)

- 10mn new unemployed only two weeks (3.3mn, then 6.6mn). In the US, Lose job, lose unemployment insurance. 

- “In the early innings of the crisis, it was obvious that the forced closure of city streets would be an apocalypse-level event for restaurants, the travel industry, concerts, amusement parks, and any other company in the business of attracting a crowd.”
  Social distancing, hand washing, etc, will slow commerce. “But the economic stoppage is now rippling into almost every sector of the economy. When restaurants and stores cannot open, they can’t order new supplies. When farms can’t supply restaurants with food, they can’t afford new equipment. Without new equipment orders, manufacturers have to lay off workers.”
- DT thinks the choice is between subsidising firms and workers so the latter remain employed, on the one hand, and on the other laying off and then paying unemployment insurance. DQ:  But not all else equal, transmission and infection in the first much worse?

Time to get back your freedom, and regain the right to work, travel, assemble, socialise, worship. “Tyrannical Governor”, “police state policies”. “Nanny state”. “Martial law”.

Haas, Richard. 2020. "The Pandemic Will Accelerate History Rather Than Reshape It", Foreign Affairs (07 Apr)

- Not every crisis is a turning point (vs my preferred "A crisis is a terrible thing to waste."), despite most analysts suggesting the world will be fundamentally different:

  - New world order led by China vs demise of China's putative global leadership
  - End of globalisation vs new era of global cooperation
  - "Supercharge nationalism, undermine free trade". Regime change

- Critical factors for recovery

  1. Hygiene and social distancing followed by populations;
  2. Quick, accurate, affordable testing; antiviral drugs, vaccine;
  3. Economic relief for people and businesses.

  "Globalization is a reality, not a choice"

Karabell, Zachary. 2020. "[Can History’s Biggest Stimulus Stave Off a Coronavirus Depression?](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-04-16/can-historys-biggest-stimulus-stave-coronavirus-depression)", Foreign Affairs (16 Apr)

- In 1934 Keynes's criticism of Roosevelt's New Deal was that it wasn't enough, that government needed "to dramatically increase spending and allow for higher deficits". Roosevelt didn't budge but kept government spending to come out at about US\$700bn (in today's dollars) over the entire period.  Other programs (UK's National Health System; the Nordic countries, and then the rest of Europe; Lyndon Johnson's Great Society programs) worldwide would eventually come to trillions of US dollars, but came in over decades.
- Reagan-Thatcher withdrew.
- But then 2008 GFC led to the US government bailing out banking, insurance, auto industries US\$800bn, then approved stimulus package similar size (and the Fed engaged into quantitative easing); EU bailout less than US\$300bn.
- COVID-19 pandemic has led to the US government authorising spending one third of annual GDP in months. Within weeks in March and up to mid-Apr, together with the Fed, more than US\$6tn injected into US economy. Similarly in Europe  and ECB. Direct subsidy of private payrolls (Norway, Italy, France, UK). China, Japan, Republic of Korea had led the way.

"... an experiment in hyper-Keynesiasm so large the best analogy comes from military doctrine": Overwhelming force

1. Does excessive spending financed by monetary expansion cause hyper-inflation?  Zimbabwe
2. Does excessive government intervention lead to excesses and lowered economic growth? 
3. Is there still a threshold debt-GDP ratio above which economies perform badly? Japan's 230%: sure anemic growth but also economic stability, low inflation, widely-shared affluence.

- *Few Countries Are Buying the Model or the Message From Beijing*

(2020.04.19 1730h) The Economist 18 Apr 2020

- "Is China Winning?"
- "Fumbling for the Exit Strategy" // Hard vs Soft Lockdown
- "Creating Immunity to COVID-19"
  1. Phase I to Phase III trials typically take 18 months; Ebola at 10 months was the fastest.
  2. Antigen - provokes the body to generate antibodies and other immune responses. Infected cells display antigens to draw attention of the body's immune system. This produces antibodies to fight the viral infection.
  3. Antibodies are proteins that stick to antigens, preventing further infection and tagging virus particles for destruction.  Antibodies take time to respond. COVID-19 patients only start producing antibodies in second week of symptoms showing.
  4. Pre genetic engineering, doctors exposed those seeking treatment in three distinct ways
     1. **Live-attenuated vaccine** [i.e., a disabled virus]. Examples include measles, mump, rubella.
     2. **Inactivated virus**. Examples include Salk polio and seasonal-flu vaccines.
     3. The **antigen itself**. Taken from infected blood, e.g., Hepatitis B vaccine
  5. With genetic engineering, other methods now possible
- However, key: vaccine profits are low. Yes, pandemic but those have a way of vanishing quickly. Not many profit-driven (Western pharmaceutical) companies end up producing vaccines. The capabilities are concentrated in just four: GSK, Johnson and Johnson, Pfizer, and Sanofi, and they are all wary of developing vaccines for pandemics. When the pandemic is over, so too does the market vanish and profits along with that.

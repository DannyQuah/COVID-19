- <details><summary>Confirmation bias</summary>"[...] tendency to seize upon information that confirms our preferred position or initial hypothesis. Threats such as pandemics that evolve in a nonlinear fashion (i.e., they start small but exponentially intensify) are especially tricky to confront because of the challenges of rapidly interpreting what is happening in real time. The most effective time to take strong action is extremely early, when the threat appears to be small — or even before there are any cases. But if the intervention actually works, it will appear in retrospect as if the strong actions were an overreaction. This is a game many politicians don’t want to play."</details>

- <details><summary>"An effective response [...] needs to be orchestrated as a coherent system."</summary>Locking down one region but not others just produces a mass exodus, spreading the virus to regions where it was not yet present. "While the public discussion of the policies followed in these countries often focuses on single elements of their models (such as extensive testing), what truly characterizes their effective responses is the multitude of actions that were taken at once. Testing is effective when it’s combined with rigorously contact tracing, and tracing is effective as long as it is combined with an effective communication system that collects and disseminates information on the movements of potentially infected people, and so forth.</details>

- <details><summary>Lombardy vs Veneto</summary>Veneto extensively tested, and reduced burden; Lombardy, although richer, took a more conservative approach, tested half what Veneto did per capita, and focused only on symptomatic cases, limiting proactive tracing and protecting health care personnel.</details>

- <details><summary>Notes</summary> The WHO report of 28 Feb https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf "China’s bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic. This decline in COVID-19 cases across China is real."  The question now is whether the world can take lessons from China’s apparent success—and whether the massive lockdowns and electronic surveillance measures imposed by an authoritarian government would work in other countries.  “This report poses difficult questions for all countries currently considering their response to COVID-19,” says Steven Riley, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London. Lawrence Gostin, a global health law scholar at Georgetown University [...] Gostin warns against applying the model elsewhere. “I think there are very good reasons for countries to hesitate using these kinds of extreme measures.”</details>

- <details><summary>Findings:</summary>The group also reviewed the massive data set that Chinese scientists have compiled. They learned that about 80% of infected people had mild to moderate disease, 13.8% had severe symptoms, and 6.1% had life-threatening episodes of respiratory failure, septic shock, or organ failure. The case fatality rate was highest for people over age 80 (21.9%), and people who had heart disease, diabetes, or hypertension. Fever and dry cough were the most common symptoms. Surprisingly, only 4.8% of infected people had runny noses. Children made up a mere 2.4% of the cases, and almost none was severely ill. For the mild and moderate cases, it took 2 weeks on average to recover. [...] “China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile, and aggressive disease containment effort in history,” the report notes.</details>

- <details><summary>Individual quotes:</summary>“China is unique in that it has a political system that can gain public compliance with extreme measures,” Gostin says. “But its use of social control and intrusive surveillance are not a good model for other countries.”   [...] Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development: “No one else in the world really can do what China just did.Nor should they, says lawyer Alexandra Phelan, a China specialist at Georgetown’s Center for Global Health Science and Security. “Whether it works is not the only measure of whether something is a good public health control measure,” Phelan says. “There are plenty of things that would work to stop an outbreak that we would consider abhorrent in a just and free society.””

"[Macroeconomic Implications of COVID-19: Can Negative Supply Shocks Cause Demand Shortages?](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/macroeconomic-implications-of-covid-19-can-negative-supply-shocks-cause-demand-shortages/)", BFI University of Chicago Working Paper (Apr)

Abstract: We present a theory of Keynesian supply shocks: supply shocks that trigger changes in aggregate demand larger than the shocks themselves. We argue that the economic shocks associated to the COVID-19 epidemic—shutdowns, layoffs, and firm exits—may have this feature. In one-sector economies supply shocks are never Keynesian. We show that this is a general result that extend to economies with incomplete markets and liquidity constrained consumers. In economies with multiple sectors Keynesian supply shocks are possible, under some conditions. A 50% shock that hits all sectors is not the same as a 100% shock that hits half the economy. Incomplete markets make the conditions for Keynesian supply shocks more likely to be met. Firm exit and job destruction can amplify the initial effect, aggravating the recession. We discuss the effects of various policies. Standard fiscal stimulus can be less effective than usual because the fact that some sectors are shut down mutes the Keynesian multiplier feedback. Monetary policy, as long as it is unimpeded by the zero lower bound, can have magnified effects, by preventing firm exits. Turning to optimal policy, closing down contact-intensive sectors and providing full insurance payments to affected workers can achieve the first-best allocation, despite the lower per-dollar potency of fiscal policy.

(Yik Ying WA 2020.03.30 0742h) I can also suggest under the Scientific and Technical responses, to include the good work by Linfa in understanding the virology that has helped to design and apply serology kits; and also the rapid technological response by our A*STAR colleagues in designing the Veredus test kit for antigen testing - this allowed Singapore to embark on our very robust response to test widely and rigorously.
